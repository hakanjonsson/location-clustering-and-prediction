In this IPython notebook you will learn how to retrieve location data form the Sony Lifelog API and apply machine learning to it in order to make predictions, using Python. You can view the notebook here, by clicking the ipynb file (since github supports rendering ipynb files). To experiment with the code, clone the repository and launch the notebook on your local Ipython Notebook server. To install ipython notebook, you can use pip:

```pip install "ipython[notebook]"```
